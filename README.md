# Humanity
As Humans: we all have the responsibilities, towards = other
== human beings!, 
to take them, out of a, Distress /Pain/Sorrow/Harshness/Hardship/Poverty/Humiliation/Embarssments/Dishonorship;
lets all pray for the better tomorrow = for our future genrations of this beautiful planet that we all live in! 
lets not be greedy, because at the end of the day ; you &&, I, go back to our loard -->> for ever --->>>&& for good!,
therefore why this much hate towards other/another human being/beings?
Lets not forge: the dark, nights, of the dark, grave; that one day, before you, or one day, after you, we all will be,
sleeping in the wet mudd alone, above the water; and below the ground, with the snakes/spiders/scorpions etc,
would be eating our bodies after we all die!. 
Humanity should come first to your head not money!?
If you are a good human being; you will get, more than , you have asked for!,
however; if you stay greedy than, there is no coming back,
&& there is no forgiveness, in the court , of Allah == Almighty God!.

with respect and love;
with shower of love, with all you wonderful human beings out there, God bless.
